<h2>Computer Science Undergraduate Advising Manual</h2>
</center>

<p> Welcome to the Computer Science Department!  The current
Department Chair is Prof. Greg Hager and the Director of Undergraduate
Studies (DUS) is Dr. Joanne Selinski.  We hope you will find this manual
to be a helpful guide as an undergraduate in our department.  We also
have many resources available on-line through our department
website: <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu">www.cs.jhu.edu</a>.  Our main
office is located in 224 Croft Hall (formerly the New Engineering
  Building, or NEB).  There you will
find the administrative staff, as well as faculty mailboxes.

<h3 id=programs>Program Options </h3>

<p>
The Computer Science Department offers three types of undergraduate programs.
For those who intend to pursue a mainstream career in computer science, we
recommend the Bachelor of Science degree, which is
accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission
of ABET, http://www.abet.org. For those who want
a broader program of study, perhaps so that computing technology will empower
them in other fields, we offer a Bachelor of Arts program.  Students in other
majors may also choose to complete a Minor in computer science.  This advising
manual applies to these three programs.  For specific program degree
requirements, please see below.
</p>

<p>
There are several other closely related degree options that might
interest you, however they are not addressed in this manual.  The
Computer Science Department and the Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering jointly offer a bachelor degree in Computer
Engineering.  There is also a Minor in Computer Integrated Surgery,
managed by the CISST ERC and a Minor in Robotics offered through the
LCSR.  And lastly, you may find the MSE in Robotics offered by LCSR, or
the Masters in Information
Security (MSSI) offered through the Information Security Institute to be an
attractive next step.  Those masters programs are distinct from the graduate
programs in Computer Science (MSE and PhD) that students may also
progress into.  General information on concurrently pursuing a masters
degree while finishing an undergraduate degree is included below.
</p>

<h3 id=declare>Declaring a Major or Minor </h3>

<p> The first step in declaring a first or second major, or a minor in
computer science is to visit the Director of Undergraduate Studies
(DUS).  This is currently Dr. Joanne Selinski, who may be found in Croft
222.  She will review your courses and provide guidance on choosing
the most appropriate program of study.  She also will help you choose
a CS faculty advisor if you decide to pursue a major.  In order to
formally declare, you must bring the appropriate form to Joanne to
complete, and then return it to the Advising Office and/or the
Registrar.  Students declaring a minor should check with their major
department as to whether they require any additional declaration forms
as well. Second majors and minors will be reflected in ISIS once this
  is done. </p>

<h3 id=advisors>Advisors </h3>

<p> CS first and second majors are all assigned an advisor from among
the CS faculty.  Joanne advises all the CS minors.  Once an advisor is
chosen, it is your responsibility to schedule a meeting at least once
a semester in order to discuss your general well-being, academic
progress, and semester course selections.  You are also encouraged to
discuss extracurricular activities, research, career and graduate
school plans with your advisor.  You will be given your advisor's
email address, and general office location.  Please remember that our
faculty do travel for conferences and other activities, so you should
try to schedule necessary meetings at least one week in advance.
However, most faculty have an open door policy welcoming students for
informal chats if you catch them in their office.</p>

<p>As you get to know our faculty and the field of CS better, you may request
an advisor change to one whose interests match yours, or simply someone with
whom you would prefer to work.  If so, simply bring an advisor
change form to Joanne, and then return it to the Registrar to complete the
advisor change process.  It is recommended that you ask your intended new
advisor if he or she will take you on as an advisee before requesting a
change.  (We try to maintain a reasonable balance of advisees/faculty
member.)</p>

<p> You have several resources for advising in addition to your major
faculty advisor.  Joanne serves as a general advisor for the
department.  However, she will only sign forms or release holds for
assigned advisors if they are unavailable and ask her to act on their
behalf.  She is always available for general consultation on degree
programs, your progress, future options, special opportunities within
the department and school, and life in general.  At the school level,
the <a href=http://www.engineering.jhu.edu/academic-advising>WSE
Advising Office</a> in Shaffer 103 provides many services for
engineering students.  These include general advising on school-wide
policies and opportunities, as well as special help for academic
struggles.  Lastly, the <a href=http://www.advising.jhu.edu/>Homewood
Advising Office</a> in Garland Hall, 3rd floor North, provides support
for academics including tutoring and pre-professional advising, as
well as programs such as Study Abroad.  We strongly advise all
students to register with the
<a href=http://www.jhu.edu/~careers>Career Center</a> as early as
possible for their expertise and events regarding internships and job
opportunities.</p>

<h3 id=cert>Degree Certification </h3>

<p> Students are expected to follow the degree requirements in effect
at the time they declared a major or minor in computer science.
However, you also have the option of satisfying a more recent set of
requirements.  It is imperative in either case that you follow one
complete set of requirements.  You cannot mix and match from various
years.  Students should consult with their advisors regarding their
program of study, but ultimately it is each student's responsibility
(not the advisor's) to make sure he or she has met all the
requirements.  Under special circumstances a student may request a
waiver or substitution of a departmental requirement.  This must be
first approved by the faculty advisor, and in some cases also by the
department DUS or chair.  Any approved exceptions must be documented
with an email to Joanne, as well as a WSE substitution/waiver
form.  </p>

<p>Students must keep track of their degree progess using a
departmental worksheet.  These Excel files, one
for <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/current-undergraduate/majorWorksheet.xls">majors
(BS and BA)</a> and one
for <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/current-undergraduate/minorwksht.xls">the
minor</a>, are all available from the department website.  Majors must
bring updated copies of this worksheet to each semesterly advising
meeting and email a copy to Joanne every semester.  Once their last
semester courses are finalized, students must give Joanne a final
worksheet for degree verification.  All students are required to
submit a "Graduation Application Form" to the registrar in their
senior year as well, listing all degrees and programs they expect to
complete.  Lastly, majors are required to complete a departmental
Senior Exit Survey, which also gets returned to Joanne.  </p>


<h3 id=computers>Computer Use</h3>

<p> The CS Department provides a computer lab for its undergraduate
students, located in Croft 225-227.  It currently houses several
different types of computing environments.  There is a large
collaboration room consisting of conference tables with internet and
electrical hook-ups for laptop use, a small fridge, sink and lounge
area.  The smaller room contains individual Windows workstations.
Students have 24/7 secure access to the lab through their J-cards once
validated.  Additional facilities are available at the campus level,
including general purpose computing labs, a digital media center, and
wireless access to the Internet.</p>

<p>All CS students are eligible to receive accounts to access our
undergraduate unix file server, as well as the Windows machines in the lab.
In order to get access, you must submit an Account Request
Form, available in the department main office, Croft 224.  This generally takes
a few days to process, then the computer staff will contact you to give you
login and password information.  You will need to bring your J-card to them in
order to set-up access to the computer lab.</p>

<p>The unix server provides software that you will use in many
courses, as well as email.  The department maintains several mailing
lists for sending notices to students.  Make sure that the support
staff and the DUS have the email address that you prefer to use on
their lists.  If you are not going to use your CS account for email,
then you should set up an automatic forward to your email of
choice.  Please consult the computer support FAQ wiki on the
department webpages to learn how to do common tasks.  If you have
questions or problems regarding the CS computing facilities at any
point, please email "support@cs.jhu.edu" and be as specific as
possible regarding the problem.  </p>

<h3 id=research>Research and Honors</h3>

<p> In accordance with Hopkins' mission as a research university,
undergraduate students in computer science are encouraged to gain some
research experience.  The primary mechanism for getting involved is to
approach a faculty member whose area interests you and ask how you can
participate.  Generally the faculty member will expect you to have a
course in their area in order to get a background for actual research
projects.  Several upper level courses have project components which often
lead to further research.  Also, some research groups may have opportunities
to learn about their area while serving as a research lab administrator or
webmaster.</p>

<p>In addition to the various independent undergraduate courses available in
the department, there are several programs specifically designed to promote
undergraduate research: the Pistritto Research Fellowship and the Senior
Honors Thesis.  Although both programs are usually pursued as individual
efforts, they have supported group projects in the past.</p>

<p>The Pistritto Research Fellowship is an application based
program which awards a stipend to a student annually for research in
information visualization.  A call for applications is sent via email each
spring for the following academic year.  The fellowship recipient may choose
to pursue the research during the summer or during the regular school
year, in conjunction with the sponsoring faculty member.</p>

<p>The Senior Honors Thesis program enables students with CS course GPAs of
3.5 or greater to pursue a full year (6 credits) of research with a faculty
member.  Interested students must submit a thesis proposal in spring of their
junior year.  If accepted, they will register for the courses 600.519 and
600.520 during senior year while doing the research.  They are required to
give a presentation on their work and submit a final thesis report at the end
of the spring semester.  With departmental faculty approval of the work, the
student will then receive the distinction "Departmental Honors with Thesis" on
his or her final transcript.  Please visit the Senior Thesis webpage at <a
href=http://www.cs.jhu.edu/undergraduate-honors>www.cs.jhu.edu/undergraduate-honors</a>
for more details.</p>

<p>Departmental Honors (without thesis) are awarded to students who graduate
with a computer science course GPA of 3.5 or above.</p>

<h3 id=interns>Internships and Careers</h3>

<p> Students are encouraged to pursue internships during winter and
summer breaks.  Generally these are done for money in the CS field.
However, the unversity does have policies regarding receiving credit
instead of pay for appropriately oriented work.  The CS career
coordinator is Dr. Peter Froehlich.  He maintains and develops
contacts with many companies, both local and national, to facilitate
internship and job opportunities.  Please check your CS email and keep
your eyes out for flyers about company visits and information sessions
within the department.  You should also register with the campus
Career Development Office in order to stay abreast of campus wide
visits and job fairs.  It is always the student's responsibility to
apply directly to a company for any internships or jobs which interest
them.  We do not have the authority to place students into any
positions.</p>

<h3 id=groups>Student Groups </h3>

<p> The CS department supports three student groups. First, we have a
JHU Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).  The ACM
is an international professional organization of computer scientists.
All students with an interest in computer science are encouraged to
get involved in the ACM.  The group has an office in Croft basement and runs
weekly meetings on Thursday evenings during the school year.  They also
sponsor special events, which include pizza & movie nights, as well as
local and regional programming contests.  Their website is
<a href=http://www.acm.jhu.edu>www.acm.jhu.edu</a>.</p>

<p>We also have a JHU Chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE), which
is the international computer science honor society.  Students may apply for
acceptance to UPE in their junior or senior years.  Acceptance is based
largely on academics (CS GPAs in particular), with some consideration for
service as well.  Members of our UPE chapter participate in various recruiting
and other service projects in the department throughout the school year.
Their website is <a href=http://www.acm.jhu.edu/~upe>www.acm.jhu.edu/~upe</a>.</p>

<p>Women in the department will hopefully join WiCS, our women in CS
  group.  Our main events are monthly dinner meetings with outside
  guest speakers.  We also meet informally most weeks for "coding circles".
  These are fun gatherings where we eat chocolate, talk about courses,
  help each other with homework (within the bounds of the ethics code
  of course), do our nails, talk about outside activities, careers,
  and whatever else might come up.  </p>

<h3 id=concur>Concurrent Program </h3>

<p>
The concurrent program at Hopkins enables undergraduates to apply for
and begin taking courses towards a Masters degree before completing
their bachelor degrees.  Most students apply for the program in their
junior year, and will finish both degrees in five years total.  It is
not necessary for your undergraduate major and your masters degree to
be in the exact same field.  For example, many CS undergraduates do
the concurrent program to get a Masters in Security Informatics.
Mixing the degrees is also an alternative to doing a double major in
closely related fields such as CS and computer engineering or math.
As a concurrent student, you must satisfy all the requirements of your
bachelors degree as well as all the requirements of the masters
degree.  Some departments may permit an overlap of at most two
courses.  All other courses, including undergraduate electives, must
be separate and distinct for the two degrees.  If you are interested
in applying for the concurrent program, please see our Graduate
Program Coordinator, Cathy Thorton, in Croft 224, or simply apply
on-line through our website:
<a href=http://www.cs.jhu.edu/grad-admissions-info>www.cs.jhu.edu/grad-admissions-info</a>.
</p>

<h3 id=reqs>Major Degree Requirements </h3>

<p>This section provides the nitty-gritty details and clarifications
  of the requirements for the BS and BA major programs.  It is
  organized according to requirement category, and within each
  provides specifics for each program.</p>

<h4>Computer Science Courses</h4>
<p>Required courses:
<ul>
<li>600.104 Computer Ethics (BS only)</li>
<li>600.107 Intro Programming in JAVA or AP equivalent</li>
<li>600.120 Intermediate Programming</li>
<li>600.226 Data Structures</li>
<li>600.233 Computer System Fundamentals (formerly 600.333)</li>
<li>600.271 Automata and Computation Theory</li>
<li>600.363/463 Algorithms (added Fall 2011)</li>
</ul>

The total number of CS credits must be at least 42 for the BS and 33
for the BA (formerly 30, changed in 2013), including the required
courses and upper level courses (>=300).  BA students must have at
least 15 upper level credits; BS students must have at least 16 upper
level credits.  Furthermore, BS students must have at least one upper
level course in each classification area of Analysis, Applications and
Systems.  (An exhaustive list of the area classifications for each of
our courses may be found on the department’s Web site.)  BS students
must also take at least one of the following courses which contain
oral communication components: 600.255, 600.321/421, 600.355, 600.392,
600.446, 600.493, 600.520.  This course may overlap other course
requirements, for example to count as oral and applications.
<p>
These additional rules regarding the CS course requirements apply to
students in both programs:
<ul>
<li> At most 3 credits of short courses (1 credit each) can be counted
toward this requirement.</li>
<li> No courses with grades below C- or with S/U grades can be used to
  fulfill this requirement, unless they are not offered for a
  grade.</li>
<li> With the adviser's explicit permission regarding course
  selections, up to 6 (BS) or 3 (BA) of the required CS credits may be
  taken in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering or
  the Information Security Institute.</li>
<li> The limits on total independent credits (including 600.491-492)
are 6 for the BS and 3 for the BA.  However, students doing the Senior
Honors Thesis (600.519-520) may use an additional three credits of
independent work toward their CS requirements.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Math Courses</h4>
<p>CS majors must take the following courses:
<ul>
  <li>110.108 Calculus I or AP equivalent</li>
  <li>110.109 Calculus II or AP equivalent</li>
  <li>550.171 Discrete Mathematics</li>
</ul>
The total math credits must be at least 22 for the BS and 18 for the
BA.  All courses in this category must be from one of the two math
departments on campus: Mathematics or Applied Math and Statistics.  ('Q'
designated courses in other departments can not be counted here.)  For
the BS all the remaining courses must be 200-level or above.  For the
BA at least one must be 200-level or above.  Lastly, the BS math
courses must include coverage of both probability and statistics.  For
BS students, AP Statistics credit covers the need for statistics (not
probability) but may not be counted towards the math credit requirements.
Some highly recommended math electives are Probability &amp;
Statistics, Calculus III, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations.
</p>

<h4>Science Courses</h4>
<p>The required number of basic science credits is 16 for the BS and
  12 for the BA.  At least two semesters of physics or two semesters
  of chemistry, with the associated laboratories, must be included.
  (The BA permits one of each.)  AP credit is an acceptable substitute
  for these courses and labs.  The remaining courses must be chosen in
  accordance with the list posted on the department's Web site, which
  includes most courses from the five basic science departments:
  Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Biophysics, Earth &amp; Planetary
  Sciences.  It also includes 'N' designated engineering courses, and
  some 'N' designated courses from Neuroscience &amp; Cognitive
  Science, but not all.  It does not include 'N' courses in other KSAS
  departments.  At most 2 credits of intersession (S/U) 'N' courses
  may be applied towards this requirement.  If it's not obvious
  whether a particular course will count towards this requirement, ask
  your advisor or Joanne.</p>

<h4>Liberal Arts</h4>
<p>The liberal arts requirements can be divided into three groups: H/S
  courses, foreign languages, and writing courses.
<ul>
<li>
  Six courses, each at least 3 credits, in the humanities and social
  sciences must be taken. These courses must have either an 'H' or 'S'
  area designator on them, but can be from any department.  For the BA
  degree, at least two of these courses must be at the 300-level or
  above.  Furthermore, a subset of the courses selected to satisfy
  this requirement should demonstrate coherence within an area.</li>
<li>
BA students are required to take at least 6 credits of foreign
  language in addition to the six H/S required courses.  BS students
  are not required to take a foreign language, but they 
  may count foreign language courses towards
  broadening electives (see below), or towards the H/S requirement
  above, even if they don't carry an 'H' or 'S' designator.  However,
  they must still have at least six (>=3)-credit courses to fulfill the H/S
  requirement.</li>
<li>The university requires writing ('W') designated courses, each at least
  3 credits, for all degree programs.  BS students must take at
  least 2 of these courses, and BA students must take at least 4.  The
  courses used to satisfy this requirement may overlap with other
  categories, such as H/S credits or electives.  Students must receive
  at least a C- grade or better in these writing courses. At least one
  of the following options should be chosen:
<ul>
  <li>060.113 Expository Writing</li>
  <li>220.105/106 Intro to Fiction and Poetry Writing </li>
  <li>661.110 Professional Communication</li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Electives and Total Credits</h4>
<p>The total number of credits required for the BS degree is 126, and
  120 for the BA.  The requirements above add up to 98 credits for the
  BS and 84 credits for the BA, leaving room for electives.  BS
  students must take at least 12 elective credits in the humanities,
  social science, arts, business, science, engineering or other
  disciplines that serve to broaden the student's background. These 12
  broadening credits are in addition to the H/S requirements above,
  and may be anything other than CS, ECE or math courses.  Except for
  electives, courses should not be taken on a
  satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis.  Freshmen majors are expected to
  take 600.105 M&amp;Ms as one of their elective credits.  By
  university policy, no more than 18 D or D+ credits can be counted
  toward the total credit requirements for a degree.
</p>

A sample schedule may be found on-line for
the <a href="BSsample.pdf">BS</a> degree.
</p>


<h3 id=conce>Tracks </h3>

<p>The faculty have developed several tracks within the major
  in order to help students plan a course of study focusing on a
  particular area.  Many of these highlight the particular strengths
  of our faculty and research here at Hopkins.  It is important to
  emphasize that majors are not required to choose a track, they are
  simply options for customizing your studies.  Below you will find
  detailed descriptions for five tracks: <a href=#nlp>Natural
  Language Processing</a>, <a href=#se>Software
  Engineering</a>, <a href=#is>Information
  Security</a>, <a href=#games>Video Game Design</a>,
  and <a href=#>Robotics</a>.  Others are likely to be added in the future.
</p>

<h4 id=nlp>Natural Language Processing </h4>

<p>
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial
intelligence.  Its goal is to build programs that can analyze,
understand, produce, and transform text in natural human languages
such as English, Chinese, or Malayalam.  Natural languages are
fascinatingly complex symbolic systems.  Unlike programming languages,
they were not designed to be easy for computers to understand.  Yet
humans cope with them effortlessly.
</p>

<p>
Major questions in NLP include: How should we formally represent the
structure and meaning of words, sentences, or documents?  What
algorithms can efficiently find the most likely meaning for a given
sentence -- or the best sentence to express a given meaning?  
What exactly do these algorithms need to know about English, Chinese,
Malayalam, or the topics that the sentences discuss? Must we write
down that knowledge ourselves, or can our computers automatically
learn languages from available data?  Finally, what practically useful
applications can we devise?
</p>

<p>NLP skills are in demand for applications that encounter large
quantities of text or speech.  Examples include search engines,
recommendation systems, digital libraries, word processors, email
interfaces, cell phone and PDA services, market research, automated
customer service, medical records entry and analysis, national
security applications, education software, information access and
communication by the disabled, language services like translation and
transcription, and all manner of data mining efforts that try to
determine what a community knows or thinks.  NLP skills are also very
relevant to computational biology, computational finance, music
processing, speech processing, data mining, machine learning,
linguistics, cognitive science, and other areas of artificial
intelligence.
</p>

<p>
A 4-year program of study should include coursework from the three
major technical areas needed for NLP.  Linguistics studies the formal
properties of natural language; statistics is used to learn from data
what the best output might be; and computational algorithms are used
to search efficiently for the best output or the best statistical
model in an enormous space of possibilities.  
</p>

<p>
Courses marked below with an asterisk should almost always be
included.  F/S indicate which courses have historically been offered
in fall/spring.
</p>

<p>
<em>Core courses.</em>  Students concentrating in NLP should take at least two
of the following courses, in any order:
<pre>
   (F) 600.465 Natural Language Processing *
   (S) 600.466 Information Retrieval and Web Agents
   (S) 600.666 Information Extraction from Speech and Text
</pre>
They will want to take 600.465 as soon as feasible (after completing
600.226 Data Structures).  
</p>

<p>
<em>Algorithms.</em>  NLP concentrators will also want to study methods that
are useful for artificial intelligence more generally.  They should
take at least two of the following courses, in any order:
<pre>
   (S) 600.335/435 Artificial Intelligence
   (S) 600.325/425 Declarative Methods
   (F,S) 600.363/463 Introduction to Algorithms
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<em>Linguistics.</em>  All NLP concentrators should take at least one of the
following 300-level linguistics courses, typically including syntax.
Note that all 050.xxx courses count as "broadening electives" for the
CS major.  
<pre>
   (F) 050.320/620 Syntax I *
   (F) 050.317/617 Semantics I
   (S) 050.325/625 Phonology I 
</pre>
All of these courses expect some prior exposure to linguistics,
typically via 050.102, 050.240, or 600.465.
</p>

<p>
Students who choose the track early can obtain useful
background in linguistics, psycholinguistics and formal language
theory starting in the freshman or sophomore year.  The following
courses have no prerequisites:
<pre>
   (S) 600.271 Automata and Computation Theory * (required for CS degree)
   (S) 050.102 Language and Mind
   (S) 050.240 The World of Language
</pre>
</p>

<p>      
<em>Statistics.</em>  Modern NLP relies heavily on statistical methods to make
sense of ambiguous language and to learn from data.  While all CS
majors are required to take some probability and statistics,
concentrators in NLP should obtain a firm grounding in machine
learning and its mathematical underpinnings.  They should take
<pre>
   (S) 600.475 Machine Learning *
   (F) 550.420 Introduction to Probability
   (S) 550.430 Introduction to Statistics 
</pre>
although if absolutely necessary, this may be condensed to
<pre>
   (S) 600.475 Machine Learning *
   (F,S) 550.310 Probability and Statistics 
</pre>
Students are also encouraged to consider
<pre>
   (F) 520.447 Introduction to Information Theory and Coding
   (F) 550.361 Introduction to Optimization
</pre>
Most of these courses can be applied toward the mathematics
requirements of the CS degree.
</p>

<p>
<em>5-year program.</em>  Students in the concurrent BS/MS program will
typically take a larger selection of the above courses, and take more
of them at the 400 or 600 level.  In the fourth or fifth year (after
taking 600.465 or 600.666), they will want to participate in research
activities or special-topics courses related to NLP.  Such offerings
vary from year to year, but generally include the following 1-credit
ongoing speaker series and reading groups:
<pre>
   (F,S) 520.603/604 Current Topics in Language and Speech Processing
   (F,S) 600.765 Selected Topics in Natural Language Processing
   (F,S) 600.766 Selected Topics in Meaning, Translation and
                 Generation of Text
</pre>
</p> 

<h4 id=se>Software Engineering</h4>

<p>
A Software Engineer is a professional programmer: someone with broad
background in Computer Science who can successfully tackle large
software projects using modern software development tools in a
systematic and disciplined fashion.
</p>

<p>
Software engineers should know how to elicit requirements, design,
implement, and test software.  The software engineering track
focuses on these core skills as well as the broader knowledge needed
including how the software should interact with the underlying
operating system, database, and network.
</p>

<p>
Courses marked below with an asterisk should almost always be
included.  F/S indicate which courses have historically been offered
in fall/spring.
</p>

<p>
<em>Core courses.</em>  Students concentrating in Software Engineering should
take the following two core courses:
<pre>
   (F) 600.321/421 Object-Oriented Software Engineering *
   (S) 600.392 CS Design Project *
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<em>Computer Systems.</em>  Software Engineering concentrators need to have a
broad understanding of computer systems since large-scale software is
developed in the context of a complex deployment of computers,
software, databases, and networks.  Students should take at least
three of the following courses, in any order:
<pre>
   (F) 600.315/415 Databases

<p>
<em>Analysis.</em>  Theoretical courses are important to improve mathematical
maturity, leading to the ability to approach problems in a more
disciplined manner.   Students should take one or more of the
following courses:
<pre>
   (F,S) 600.363/463 Intro to Algorithms
   (S) 600.325/425 Declarative Methods
   (S) 600.426 Programming Languages
   (S) 600.464/664 Randomized Algorithms
</pre>

<p><em>Probability and Statistics.</em>  Modern Software Engineering relies
heavily on probability and statistics.  Students should take
<pre>
   (F) 550.420 Introduction to Probability
   (S) 550.430 Introduction to Statistics 
     or if there is a shortage of time,
   (F,S) 550.310 Probability and Statistics
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<em>Teamwork.</em> Software Engineers need to be extremely good at working
closely with others -- 
duties are even more closely overlapping than on other engineering
projects and only team players will succeed.  Make sure you take as
many courses as you can that involve team project work, as well as
participating in extracurricular activities that are teamwork activities.

<h4 id=is>Information Security</h4>

<p>
Information Security is a broad topic description. It typically spans
every aspect of a system, including authentication, authorization,
access control, resistance to penetration, and privacy. Security must
be designed into a system from the beginning. It cannot be
retrofitted. Security analysis and design begins with a threat
model. Who are the adversaries? What are the goals of the adversary?
What are his/her capabilities? How resourceful and wealthy is the
adversary? Once the threat model is identified, the proper level of
security can be applied.
</p>

<p>
Sub areas in security include software security, network security,
system security, security in applications, and cryptography. Each of
these sub areas can be further broken down. Some concepts span
multiple sub areas. For example, security protocols such as SSL and
SSH have strong system components and also rely on cryptographic
protocols and algorithms. Application areas include everything from
security in electronic voting, to protecting medical records, and just
about any application that talks to a network or takes user input.
</p>

<p>
The Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute (JHUISI)
makes available a Master of Science in Security Informatics (MSSI)
degree to students interested in information security that can be
included in a concurrent BS/MSSI program that addresses not only
technical issues but also relevant aspects of policy, privacy,
management, including healthcare applications. Please see the JHUISI
web site for information on the MSSI requirements.
</p>

<p>
A 4-year program of study should include coursework from the major
technical sub areas needed for Security that are listed above.
</p>

<p>
Courses marked below with an asterisk should almost always be
included.  F/S indicate which courses have historically been offered
in fall/spring. Not every course is offered every year.
</p>

<p>
<em>Core courses.</em>  Students concentrating in Security are required to take
one of the following cryptography courses:
<pre>
   (F) 600.442 Modern Cryptography*
       600.642 or 600.742 Advanced Topics in Cryptography

<h4 id=games>Video Game Design</h4>

<p>
In 2008, video games represented a market of $11.7 billion with about
68% of US households reporting gaming activity. Much like motion
pictures in the early part of the 20th century, video games have now
become a major player in the entertainment industry and are prevalent
enough to warrant academic attention from a wide variety of
disciplines. An increasing number of highly ranked universities across
the country are now offering programs that focus on video games (CMU,
Rensselaer, USC, UCSC, UCI, Cornell, etc).
</p>

<p>
Aside from being immensely relevant, courses in video game design are
by necessity also highly interdisciplinary. Students surveyed after
our first pilot course in Spring 2008 were almost unanimous about
their positive experience in working with people from a wide variety
of backgrounds. The track reflects this by suggesting a large
number of courses that would not necessarily seem particularly
"appropriate" for a CS major if we were not talking about gaming.
</p>

<p>
<em>Courses.</em>  A four-year program of study should include
coursework from both technical and artistic areas. The technical area
focuses on computer science, math, and physics; the artistic area
focuses on graphic design, modeling, and sound design. Courses marked
below with an asterisk should almost always be included.
</p>

<p>
<em>Writing Requirement.</em> Students in the Video Game
Design track must take these courses, which also fulfill their writing
requirement for the BS and can be used towards the BA writing
requirement as well.
<pre>
   JHU 220.105 Introduction to Fiction and Poetry Writing
   JHU 220.106 Introduction to Fiction and Poetry Writing
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<em>Core Courses.</em> Students in the Video Game Design track must
take the following courses. The MICA courses count as electives with
respect to the CS degree requirements.
<pre>
   JHU 600.255 Introduction to Video Game Design
   JHU 600.355 Video Game Design Project
  MICA  GD 200 Graphic Design I
  MICA  IM 200 Interactive Media I
  MICA VID 202 Sound I
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<em>Technical Area.</em> Students following the track in Video Game Design
should take at least three of the following courses. 
<pre>
   (S) JHU 600.320 Parallel Programming
   (S) JHU 600.335 Artificial Intelligence
   (F) JHU 600.337 Distributed Systems

   (F,S) JHU 550.310 Probability and Statistics *
   JHU 550.361 Introduction to Optimization
   JHU 171.105 Classical Mechanics *
</pre>

We also recommend a course on simulation of physical systems or
control theory.  Some possibilities might be: 530.201, 530.343,
   530.405, 530.414, 520.353, 520.454.

<p>
<em>Artistic Area.</em> Students pursuing the track in Video Game Design
should take at least three of the following courses. These can be used
toward Broadening Electives and general electives in our degree
programs.
<pre>
  MICA ENV 200 Space / Object I
  MICA IN 204  Lighting Design
  MICA IM 336  Interface Design and User Experience *
  MICA AN 202  Introduction to 2D Computer Animation *
  MICA AN 203  Introduction to 3D Computer Animation *
  MICA AN 363  2D Character Animation
  MICA AN 364  3D Character Animation
  MICA AN 450  Animation Post-Production
</pre>
</p>

<p>[DISCLAIMER: We are not sure about the credits of the various courses
suggested here and how they balance out. Also, we need to double-check
with MICA faculty about their courses.  MICA recently started their own
gaming program and no doubt some courses have changed.]

<h4 id=rob>Robotics </h4>

<p>
The field of Robotics integrates sensing, information processing, and
movement to accomplish specific tasks in the physical world. As such,
the study of robotics can encompass several topics, including
mechanics and dynamics, kinematics, sensing, signal processing,
control systems, planning, and artificial intelligence. Applications
of these concepts appear in many areas including medicine,
manufacturing, space exploration, disaster recovery, ordinance
disposal, deep-sea navigation, home care, and home automation.
There are variety of sub-specializations of robotics that are more
algorithmic or systems-oriented in nature. Examples include robot
motion planning, robot task planning, sensor-based mapping, computer
vision, and human-machine systems. The robotics track is
designed to emphasize these areas of work. 
</p>

<p>
For students interested in a broader exposure to robotics, the faculty
of the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR), in
collaboration with the academic departments and centers of the Whiting
School of Engineering, offers a Robotics Minor in order to provide a
structure in which undergraduate students at Johns Hopkins. The minor
is not "owned" by any one department, but rather it is managed by the
LCSR itself. Any student from any department within the university can
work toward the minor.
</p>

<p>
A 4-year program of study should include coursework from the major
technical sub areas needed for Robotics that are listed above.
