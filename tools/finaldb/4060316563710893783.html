Dear Colleagues:<P>

Following, the success of last year's Work In Progress (WIP) Sessions
during RTSS'96, I am pleased to continue that tradition by presenting
you 10 excellent WIP reports for RTSS'97. <P>

The prime purpose of RTSS WIP sessions is to provide researchers in
Academia and Industry an opportunity to discuss their evolving ideas
and gather feedback thereon from the real-time community at large.
There were 16 submissions for WIP presentations, of which 10 have been
accepted for presentation during the symposium and for inclusion in
RTSS'97 WIP proceedings.<P>

If you would like to reference any article included
in the RTSS'97 WIP Proceedings, please note that theses proceedings
are published as a Technical Report from Boston University, Computer
Science Department (BUCS-TR-97-021).<P>

Many people worked hard to make the idea of holding the WIP sessions a
reality. In particular, I would like to thank Kwei-Jay Lin for
accomodating the WIP sessions within the busy schedule of RTSS'97.
Also, I would like to thank all members of the RTSS'97 Program
Committee who helped me review these submissions.  Finally, I would
like to thank all those who submitted their work to RTSS'97 WIP
Sessions. <P>

I hope these sessions will prove beneficial, both to the WIP presenters
and to RTSS'97 attendees.<P>
