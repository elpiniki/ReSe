<div>
	Focus: political ecology of municipal solid waste in Delhi, India</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	India&rsquo;s rapid urbanization has brought promises for world-class cities in the making, such as in Delhi &ndash; and it has brought challenges such as mounting piles of garbage. Waste pickers currently represent a sizeable informal sector with over 150,000 people in Delhi alone that manage garbage as their main means of livelihood. As the city of Delhi strives to be a global city and puts infrastructure into place, privatizing waste management services threatens the livelihood of the waste pickers. Waste serves as a particularly useful lens for examining urbanization processes because it can reveal the interlinked material and symbolic underpinnings of the urban landscape as a mosaic of competing interests.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Aman Luthra&rsquo;s research explores what the problem of garbage tell us about relations within and between classes, the state and private capital in the process of urbanization in Delhi. His research draws upon theories and methods in economic geography, urban history, and anthropology to understand the nature of conflicts and alliances among competing interests in the struggle over the processes of urbanization in Delhi.</div>

		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			Jake Greear will offer a spring semester course (Jan &ndash; May 2013), &ldquo;US Environmental Policy,&rdquo; that provides an intensive introduction to the emergence, development, and functioning of key environmental policies in the United States.</div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			One of the great challenges of environmental politics is the overwhelming complexity of the issues. Yet the history of environmental policy shows us that problems can be successfully addressed in the public arena. In this course, students will gain an understanding of the problems, events, and movements out of which environmental policies arose; learn how the structure and function of environmental institutions has changed over the years; and explore contemporary challenges in the realm of environmental public policy. The course will address debates about public policy pertaining to sustainability, conservation, and environmental health, and will delve into the practical and ethical complexities inherent in environmental politics.</div>

<div>
	<br />
	Department of Geography &amp; Environmental Engineering, School of Engineering</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Focus: Small-scale water treatment technologies in developing countries.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The international development community has placed a high priority on safe drinking water given the knowledge that clean water is essential to many areas of addressing public health issues, including diarrhea, cholera and many waterborne diseases. Despite many water treatment technologies that have been found to be effective in the lab and the field, they have failed to achieve sustained, long-term use by populations that most need clean water.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Laura MacDonald&rsquo;s research will analyze the chain of processes involved in developing small-scale water treatment technologies to better understand how and why decisions were made about the technology. In particular, she will examine the role of compliance in the innovation and development process, including the influences of costs, networks of existing relationships, geographic proximity and the commitments of individuals. Her research aims to be of use to policymakers who must consider not only the impact that technology has on society but also the social shaping of technology and, in doing so, will be able to develop policy that supports the development and implementation of appropriate water treatment technologies.</div>

<div>
	<br />
	Focus: Food security, industrial-urban bias, and irrigation sustainability in China</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	China&#39;s irrigation system has deteriorated dramatically in the past three decades, plagued by a growing number of malfunctioning facilities and worsening environmental problems. The Chinese government has set a goal of food self-sufficiency; however, reversing the decline of the irrigation system is essential if this is to be accomplished. Understanding the causes of irrigation system decline is not only important for achieving food security in China; it is also important for food security and ecological sustainability on a world-scale. Given its huge population and rising consumption standards, Chinese food imports are expected to grow dramatically, contributing to rising global food prices and the expansion of resource-wasteful and ecologically unsustainable patterns of global food production and trade.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Lingli Huang&rsquo;s research will examine food production in China with a focus on the irrigation system, a critical foundation for agricultural productivity and ecological sustainability. She will examine why the irrigation system has declined, despite the economy&rsquo;s exponential growth, as well as explore possible solutions how China can reverse this trend and build a sustainable irrigation system.</div>

		Focus: Impact of pollution on human health</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		Matthew Gribble will offer a spring semester course (Jan &ndash; May 2013), &ldquo;Chemical Karma: From Pollution to Disease,&rdquo; which will follow several pollutants from their industrial sources to their human health outcomes.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		The pollutants generated by human activities often result in human exposures with important public health consequences. This course tracks several pollutants from their sources to their ultimate health risks, and describes some of the uncertainties that occur at each stage of the risk assessment process. This course will introduce fundamental principles of contaminant fate and transport, exposure assessment, and environmental epidemiology. In addition to the science, this course will also consider ethical traditions concerning behavior in closed systems, and how risk is currently communicated to and understood by the public. <a href="http://krieger.jhu.edu/publichealth/courses/Spring%202013%20PHS%20Courses.pdf">Learn more about Matthew Gribble&#39;s course</a></div>

<div>
	<br />
	Department of International Health, School of Public Health</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Focus: Urban Agriculture, public health and environmental sustainability</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	In a time when ecosystem degradation, climate change, and energy insecurity are converging to threaten food security globally and locally, urban agriculture can be a critical solution for public health and environmental sustainability. Facilitated by ample vacant land in inner cities, urban agriculture has gained traction as a way of growing a local, sustainable food system in post-industrial cities like Baltimore, emerging both from bottom-up community initiatives and top-down city policies. It is touted as a way to provide access to healthy foods in urban food deserts. It also has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with industrial food production, and is proposed to increase community resilience to climate change. However, these efforts are only successful if all stakeholders involved &ndash; including community residents, leaders, local businesses, developers, and government agencies &ndash; perceive urban agriculture as an acceptable use of land.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Melissa Poulsen&rsquo;s research explores human environmental values and perceptions and how these factors influence the ecology of the city, including land use in an urban setting. Through her research, she aims to better understand how urban agriculture meets various stakeholders&rsquo; conceptions of acceptable use of urban space, with an eye toward shaping urban policy and planning that supports urban agriculture.</div>

<div>
	<br />
	Department of Chemistry, School of Arts &amp; Sciences</div>
<div>
	<br />
	Focus: Environmentally benign molecular catalysts for solar energy conversion and fuel cell applications</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	As the search for alternatives to fossil fuel intensifies, finding ways to efficiently convert solar energy into chemical fuels for sustainable energy resources becomes increasingly important. An example of such a conversion requires a water oxidation catalyst which performs the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and an oxygen reduction catalyst which performs the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Both reactions are considered the bottleneck to developing devices that can make alternative energy more efficient and affordable because the OER and the ORR are difficult reactions to attain kinetically, and even when they are successful catalyzed, the detailed catalytic mechanism is usually not known and difficult to control.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Regina Baglia&rsquo;s research integrates chemistry with materials science and engineering to look at the mechanisms of forming and cleaving the bonds required to catalyze the OER and ORR, as well as to design an efficient, environmentally compatible catalyst to make sustainable energy resources from sunlight and water a reality in the mainstream energy markets.&nbsp;<br />
