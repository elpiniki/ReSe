		  <p><strong><em>Please select your top 2 projects from the list below and list the project numbers in your application.</em></strong></p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>Project 1: Mining  Public Health Information from Social Media</strong></p>
<p>People tweet about diseases all the time: &quot;feelin sick,  stomach ache, time to head home.&quot; By looking at millions of tweets, we can  learn useful information about public health: infection rates, drug usage,  unusual symptoms, etc. Our recent work has shown that we can mine this  information from social media. This work has been featured on CBS, NPR and the  BBC. This project will explore how to make such information accessible and  useable by public health researchers. The project will build tools for  extracting specific public health information from a live twitter stream. We'll  use machine learning and natural language processing algorithms for finding  important health trends and presenting the results to health researchers.<br />
    <strong>Required skills:</strong> Programming (preferably Java  and/or Python), Unix command line. <br />
    <strong>Preferred:</strong> Machine learning and natural  language processing experience/coursework.<br />
    <strong>Faculty Advisor:</strong> Mark Dredze (<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze">www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project  2: Building a Flexible Typed Programming Language</strong><br />
  This project involves working on a new programming language under  development in our lab, Big Bang.&nbsp; Big  Bang aims for the speed of C++ and the flexibility of Python.&nbsp; The language currently has only a core  implementation and there are many projects that need tackling, including  development of an Eclipse plugin for editing.<br />
  <strong>Required Skills:</strong> Significant programming  experience and a strong interest in programming languages.<br />
  <strong>Faculty Advisor:</strong> Scott Smith </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project  3: Machine Learning Methods for Large Scale Clinical Data Repositories</strong><br />
  Electronic Health Records contain data on visits, symptoms, test  results, procedures, and reports summarizing progression of an individual&rsquo;s  health status over time. In rare or poorly understood patient populations, such  data are particularly helpful in characterizing disease progression, early  detection, identifying treatments that are effective, identifying subgroups  that will respond to treatment and so on. However, the data are challenging:  they are heterogeneous, unstructured, contain sampling bias, and large scale.  We will develop novel Bayesian methods for integrating these data into models  for informing patient care. Fellows will have the chance to collaborate closely  with a team of multidisciplinary collaborators comprising computer scientists, statisticians,  and clinical scientists<br />
  <strong>Faculty Advisor:</strong>&nbsp;Suchi Saria</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project  4: Risk prediction from Electronic  Health Record data</strong></p>
<p>A vast amount of valuable content about a patient's health is  stored in notes dictated by the caregivers at various points of care  (admissions, discharge, test reports). This project will develop approaches for  information extraction from these data with the end goal of developing risk  prediction tools. Fellows will have the chance to collaborate closely with a  team of &nbsp;multidisciplinary collaborators  comprising computer scientists and clinical experts. <br />
    <strong>Faculty Advisor:</strong>&nbsp;Suchi Saria</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project  5: Robotic Component Fabrication  and Programming</strong></p>
<p>A new wave of open-source hardware designs for 3D-printed and  rapid-prototyped robotic mechanisms has dramatically lowered the cost of  building well-performing robotic systems. These mechanisms include  under-actuated (adaptive) robotic grippers, ergonomic interfaces for  human-machine interaction, and components for telepresence robots.<br />
  We would like to have one or more students with experience in  mechanical design and computer science build several 3D-printed robot  components and possibly write control code for those components.&nbsp; This project would involve starting by  building an existing open-source hardware design. Once a baseline gripper has  been constructed, further work involves better integration with the robotic  manipulators in the lab and adding additional sensing and instrumentation.<br />
  <strong>Required Skills:</strong><br />
  - Experience with CAD software (SolidWorks, ProE)<br />
  - Experience using rapid prototyping tools like 3D printers and  laser cutters<br />
  - Experience with mechatronic integration<br />
  - Familiarity with embedded programming in C<br />
  - Familiarity with object oriented programming (C++ or Python, NOT  JAVA)<br />

<p><strong>Project 6: Building  Virtual Interactive Environments</strong><br />
  One of the ongoing projects in CIRL is creating a smart robotic  arm for quadriplegics (<a href="https://cirl.lcsr.jhu.edu/research/human-machine-collaborative-systems/assistive-technologies-for-quadriplegics/">https://cirl.lcsr.jhu.edu/research/human-machine-collaborative-systems/assistive-technologies-for-quadriplegics/</a>).&nbsp; For testing, development,  and training purposes, virtual models of the arms working in virtual  environments can provide a safe and controlled training environment.&nbsp; This  REU student would be expected to put together a miniature virtual world (ex. a  part of a kitchen) in Linux using Gazebo or rviz with full physics simulations,  object interaction, and robot-object interaction.&nbsp; It is our hope that  this virtual reality simulator would be able to be distributed to future users  of the system so that they could safely gain dexterity with the robot in a  controlled environment before being set up with a full physical system.<br />
  <strong>Required Skills: </strong>C++ or Python  programming experience along with CAD (SolidWorks, ProE, etc. acceptable)  experience.<strong> </strong><br />

<p><strong>Project 7: Computer  Vision for Brain Mapping (Connectomics)&nbsp;</strong> <br />
  Recent  technological advances have enabled the collection of tens of terabytes of high  resolution neuroimaging data in pursuit of a map of the brain's wiring, called  a connectome. &nbsp;At the ultrastructure level, it is possible to locate every  neuron and their synaptic connections. However, solving this reconstruction  problem by hand is too time consuming and current computer vision algorithms  are inadequate for the task.&nbsp;Given the extreme size of this data is  important that our approach can scale;&nbsp;a single human brain at this  resolution will require exabytes of storage and identifying approximately 100  billion neurons and 100 trillion connections. This project will explore  using&nbsp;probabilistic&nbsp;graphical models (PGMs) as a technique to aid  neuron tracking. We are interested in assessing the feasibility of these  approaches and comparing them to existing state-of-the-art methods.<br />
  <strong>Required Skills</strong>:&nbsp; Ability to  design algorithms and write code in Python or Matlab. &nbsp;Previous experience  with graphical models (e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Hidden Markov Models)  is highly desirable but not required. Student should be able to work  independently.&nbsp;<br />
  <strong>Faculty Advisor</strong>: &nbsp;Gregory&nbsp;Hager</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project  8: Multiview learning of acoustic features</strong><strong> </strong><br />
  One of the most important challenges in  machine learning is to automate the learning of useful features from raw data.  This project will focus on multi-view learning techniques for automatic feature  learning where more than one view is available at the time of training. We will  apply these techniques to automatic speech recognition utilizing datasets with  simultaneously recorded acoustic and articulatory measurements such as tracks  of lip and tongue movements<br />
