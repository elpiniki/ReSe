<h3>
	<a href="http://gaia.jhuapl.edu/ " target="_blank">Global Assimilation of Information for Action (GAIA) </a></h3>
<p>
	GAIA is an initiative of Johns Hopkins University led by the Applied Physics Lab (APL)&nbsp;to connect decision-makers with the research community, focusing on climate disruption and its effects on society. GAIA builds connections through a series of topical cyber-enabled workshops that bring together people from a wide range of disciplines to exchange ideas and information, to assess and prioritize needs, and to develop approaches to addressing those needs. GAIA is a partnership between APL and:</p>

<h3>
	<a href="http://globalwater.jhu.edu" target="_blank">Global Water Program</a></h3>
<p>
	The Global Water Program is focused on solving the global water challenge of providing safe, sufficient water through innovation, education, and collaboration. The program taps into an extensive network of experts from the Bloomberg School of Public Health, the Whiting School of Engineering, as well as other JHU schools and non-JHU institutions to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Provide research and education that prepares professionals and students to be leaders in addressing water and sanitation issues worldwide.</li>
	<li>
		Discover solutions to domestic and international water challenges that are safe, scalable, and sustainable.</li>

<h3>
	<a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/dept/ehs/research_centers/Urban_Environmental_Health/index.html " target="_blank">NIEHS Center in Urban Environmental Health </a></h3>
<p>
	The Center identifies environmental exposures, their biological consequences and underlying susceptibility factors, the nexus of gene-environment interactions, that alone or together increase health risk for people living in urban environments, such as Baltimore. The findings are then used to develop prevention and intervention strategies to improve urban environmental health both locally and globally. The Center has three primary research areas: environmental epidemiology and exposure assessment, molecular basis of environmental disease, and public health interventions and prevention.</p>
<div>

<h3>
	<a href="http://systems.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Systems Institute</a></h3>
<p>
	The Systems Institute bring together the university&rsquo;s experts in engineering, medicine, public health, the social and physical sciences, education and other fields to solve tough national-scale problems that require a multidisciplinary approach. Some of the institute&rsquo;s initial targets may include infrastructure, education, energy strategies and other broad-based challenges such as those imposed by global environmental change. The Institute promotes collaborative research and education activities among students, faculty and researchers to address these grant challenge problems.</p>
