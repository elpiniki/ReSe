This is the first description of the key concepts of V2G: That the potential resource exceeds all current electric generation by many times, that the value is not in bulk power but in responding when needed, and that the driver sets limits based on driving need within which the grid operator dispatches based on time of electric system need. This first article is before we called the idea "V2G" and the analysis is based primarily on peak power, which subsequent work (above) shows to be a lower-value market for V2G power.<br /><br /><strong>GIVs for Wind Integration</strong><br /><br />Budischak, Cory, DeAnna Sewell, Heather Thomson, Leon Mach, Dana E.

This report documents a practical demonstration of a Grid Integrated Vehicle providing real-time frequency regulation from a single electric car.&nbsp; At the University of Delaware, on October 18, 2007, a team of engineers and officials from UD, Pepco Holdings Inc (PHI), and PJM Interconnection successfully interconnected an AC Propulsion &ldquo;eBox&rdquo; to the PJM grid using a direct AGC signal from the PJM control center.&nbsp; The vehicle was dispatched in real time as a regulation resource, like traditional generators. This report covers the engineering, market and experimental results of this proof of concept demonstration and study. &nbsp;(UD's later developments use an "aggregator" to communicate with PJM, rather than PJM communicating to individual cars, that is not covered in this earlier report.)<br /><br />Udo, Victor,  2008,  <strong><a href="http://www.energypulse.net/centers/article/article_print.cfm?a_id=1878" rel="self">"Proven at PJM:Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and Power System/Transportation Synergies,"</a></strong>, <em>Energy Pulse</em>, November 17, 2008.

This report describes a tri-fuel vehicle which was designed, built, and tested, under CARB Grant Number ICAT 01-2. The prototype vehicle is refueled and run on electricity or natural gas, or gasoline, using a series hybrid. From the abstract: The project vehicle provides 35 miles of battery-only range with highway performance capability so operation on grid electricity can eliminate operating emissions and one or more cold engine starts per day. The project vehicle can re-charge its traction battery from the grid in less than one hour. The hybrid power unit in the project vehicle can sustain battery charge at highway speeds providing long distance travel unconstrained by battery range. The hybrid power unit in the project vehicle can also generate electricity while the vehicle is parked. In this stationary mode, the hybrid power unit can operate on gasoline stored on the vehicle or on low-pressure natural gas piped to the vehicle from the gas main. While parked, the power generated can be exported as alternating current electricity either to the grid or to stand-alone loads. Interactions between the vehicle and the grid, including power export, can be controlled from remote locations via wireless internet connection. These capabilities are demonstrated in stationary testing and 6000 miles of on-road use.<br /><br />Brooks, Alec, 2002. <strong><a href="http://www.udel.edu/V2G/docs/V2G-Demo-Brooks-02-R5.pdf" rel="self">"Vehicle-to-Grid Demonstration Project: Grid Regulation Ancillary Service with a Battery Electric Vehicle&rdquo;</a></strong>, Report, AC Propulsion, December 2002. Sponsored by CARB. In addition to the test results, this report has a thorough analysis of regulation services and how V2G can provide them. From the abstract: A test vehicle was fitted with a bidirectional grid power interface and wireless internet connectivity, allowing power flow to or from the vehicle to be dispatched remotely. Power dispatch commands were sent wirelessly to the vehicle at 4-second intervals, and the vehicle response was monitored and recorded. Results showed that wireless data transmission times were within ISO system requirements, and that the energy throughput through the battery due to regulation is similar to that of typical daily driving. The value created by the service exceeds the battery wear out costs under most operating assumptions.<br /><br />Kempton, Willett, Jasna Tomić, Steven Letendre, Alex Brooks & Timothy Lipman. 2001. <strong><a href="http://www.udel.edu/V2G/docs/V2G-Cal-2001.pdf" rel="self">Vehicle-to-Grid Power: Battery, Hybrid, and Fuel Cell Vehicles as Resources for Distributed Electric Power in California.

This CARB/LADWP-sponsored report is specific to California, yet it has comprehensive analysis on V2G, some not in subsequent publications. This was the first full coverage of all three vehicle types--battery, fuel cell and hybrid vehicles, across four power markets--baseload, peak, spinning reserves, and regulation services. The approach and formulae developed and explained here are the basis for our subsequent analysis. (Although our equation notation was rationalized and standardized in our 2005 and later publications. Very brief summary of economic results: Battery vehicles (also called "electric vehicles" or EVs) with telematics and power electronics designed to allow V2G could earn $2,000 - $3,000 per year by selling a form of power called "regulation services." Fuel cell and hybrid vehicles could earn $1,500 - $2,500 per year by selling electricity as "spinning reserves." We found that V2G is economically valuable in the CalISO market for these forms of electric power that go on briefly when needed. Vehicles do not appear to be economically competitive for "baseload power," that is, constant power generation, which has lower blue per kWh and more drain on the battery, hydrogen, or fuel tank.<span style="font-size:21px; font-weight:bold; "><br /></span><span style="font-size:21px; font-weight:bold; "><br /></span><span style="font-size:20px; ">Early Conference Presentations and Unrefereed Papers</span><span style="font-size:13px; "><br /></span><br />These papers are of interest as a snapshot of where the technology and policy was circa 2000.<br /><br />Presentations from The Seattle Electric Vehicle to Grid Forum (2005).  <a href="http://www.udel.edu/V2G/ASAP_Forum_Full_Schedule.pdf" rel="self">Press release and schedule of speakers and topics</a>.<br /><br />The two papers below are from a symposium organized by Alec Brooks, "Vehicle to Grid: A new Vision for Electric Transportation," at the EVAA Electric Transportation Industry Conference (Sacramento, Dec. 2001).<br /><br />David Hawkins, from the California Independent System Operator, discusses V2G as a resource for grid regulation in California. He explains what the ISO does, and compares V2G with traditional sources of regulation--generators running at partial speed.
