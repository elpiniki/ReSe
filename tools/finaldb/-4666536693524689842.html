Manual</h1><div clas="the-content"><p>Welcome to the Computer Science Department! The current Department Chair is Prof. Greg Hager and the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) is Dr. Joanne Selinski. We hope you will find this manual to be a helpful guide as an undergraduate in our department. We also have many resources available on-line through our department website. Our main office is located in 224 Croft Hall (formerly the New Engineering Building, or NEB). There you will find the administrative staff, as well as faculty mailboxes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul class="accordion" id="accordion1"><li class="accordion-group"><div class="accordion-heading"><h4 class="accordion-title"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1" href="#accordion-panel-2">Program Options</a></h4></div><div id="accordion-panel-2" class="accordion-body collapse out"><div class="accordion-inner"><p>The Computer Science Department offers three types of undergraduate programs. For those who intend to pursue a mainstream career in computer science, we recommend the Bachelor of Science degree, which is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. For those who want a broader program of study, perhaps so that computing technology will empower them in other fields, we offer a Bachelor of Arts program. Students in other majors may also choose to complete a Minor in computer science. This advising manual applies to these three programs. For specific program degree requirements, please see below.</p><p>There are several other closely related degree options that might interest you, however they are not addressed in this manual. The Computer Science Department and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering jointly offer a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering. There is also a Minor in Computer Integrated Surgery, managed by the CISST ERC and a Minor in Robotics offered through the LCSR. And lastly, you may find the MSE in Robotics offered by LCSR, or the Masters in Information Security (MSSI) offered through the Information Security Institute to be an attractive next step. Those masters programs are distinct from the graduate programs in Computer Science (MSE and PhD) that students may also progress into. General information on concurrently pursuing a masters degree while finishing an undergraduate degree is included below.<br /></div></div></li><li class="accordion-group"><div class="accordion-heading"><h4 class="accordion-title"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1" href="#accordion-panel-3">Declaring a Major or Minor</a></h4></div><div id="accordion-panel-3" class="accordion-body collapse out"><div class="accordion-inner"><p>The first step in declaring a first or second major, or a minor in computer science is to visit the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS). This is currently Dr. Joanne Selinski, who may be found in Croft 222. She will review your courses and provide guidance on choosing the most appropriate program of study. She also will help you choose a CS faculty advisor if you decide to pursue a major. In order to formally declare, you must bring the appropriate form to Joanne to complete, and then return it to the Advising Office and/or the Registrar. Students declaring a minor should check with their major department as to whether they require any additional declaration forms as well. Second majors and minors will be reflected in ISIS once this is done.<br /></div></div></li><li class="accordion-group"><div class="accordion-heading"><h4 class="accordion-title"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1" href="#accordion-panel-4">Advisors</a></h4></div><div id="accordion-panel-4" class="accordion-body collapse out"><div class="accordion-inner"><p>CS first and second majors are all assigned an advisor from among the CS faculty. Joanne advises all the CS minors. Once an advisor is chosen, it is your responsibility to schedule a meeting at least once a semester in order to discuss your general well-being, academic progress, and semester course selections. You are also encouraged to discuss extracurricular activities, research, career and graduate school plans with your advisor. You will be given your advisor&#8217;s email address, and general office location. Please remember that our faculty do travel for conferences and other activities, so you should try to schedule necessary meetings at least one week in advance. However, most faculty have an open door policy welcoming students for informal chats if you catch them in their office.</p><p>As you get to know our faculty and the field of CS better, you may request an advisor change to one whose interests match yours, or simply someone with whom you would prefer to work. If so, simply bring an advisor change form to Joanne, and then return it to the Registrar to complete the advisor change process. It is recommended that you ask your intended new advisor if he or she will take you on as an advisee before requesting a change. (We try to maintain a reasonable balance of advisees/faculty member.)</p><p>You have several resources for advising in addition to your major faculty advisor. Joanne serves as a general advisor for the department. However, she will only sign forms or release holds for assigned advisors if they are unavailable and ask her to act on their behalf. She is always available for general consultation on degree programs, your progress, future options, special opportunities within the department and school, and life in general. At the school level, theÂ <a href="http://www.engineering.jhu.edu/academic-advising">WSE Advising Office</a>Â in Shaffer 103 provides many services for engineering students. These include general advising on school-wide policies and opportunities, as well as special help for academic struggles. Lastly, theÂ <a href="http://www.advising.jhu.edu/">Homewood Advising Office</a>Â in Garland Hall, 3rd floor North, provides support for academics including tutoring and pre-professional advising, as well as programs such as Study Abroad. We strongly advise all students to register with theÂ <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/~careers">Career Center</a>Â as early as possible for their expertise and events regarding internships and job opportunities.<br /></div></div></li><li class="accordion-group"><div class="accordion-heading"><h4 class="accordion-title"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1" href="#accordion-panel-5">Degree Certification</a></h4></div><div id="accordion-panel-5" class="accordion-body collapse out"><div class="accordion-inner"><p>Students are expected to follow the degree requirements in effect at the time they declared a major or minor in computer science. However, you also have the option of satisfying a more recent set of requirements. It is imperative in either case that you follow one complete set of requirements. You cannot mix and match from various years. Students should consult with their advisors regarding their program of study, but ultimately it is each student&#8217;s responsibility (not the advisor&#8217;s) to make sure he or she has met all the requirements. Under special circumstances a student may request a waiver or substitution of a departmental requirement. This must be first approved by the faculty advisor, and in some cases also by the department DUS or chair. Any approved exceptions must be documented with an email to Joanne, as well as a WSE substitution/waiver form.</p><p>Students must keep track of their degree progess using a departmental worksheet. These Excel files, one forÂ <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/current-undergraduate/majorWorksheet.xls">majors (BS and BA)</a>Â and one forÂ <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/current-undergraduate/minorwksht.xls">the minor</a>, are all available from the department website. Majors must bring updated copies of this worksheet to each semesterly advising meeting and email a copy to Joanne every semester. Once their last semester courses are finalized, students must give Joanne a final worksheet for degree verification. All students are required to submit a &#8220;Graduation Application Form&#8221; to the registrar in their senior year as well, listing all degrees and programs they expect to complete. Lastly, majors are required to complete a departmental Senior Exit Survey, which also gets returned to Joanne.</div></div></li><li class="accordion-group"><div class="accordion-heading"><h4 class="accordion-title"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1" href="#accordion-panel-6">Computer Use</a></h4></div><div id="accordion-panel-6" class="accordion-body collapse out"><div class="accordion-inner"><p>The CS Department provides a computer lab for its undergraduate students, located in Croft 225-227. It currently houses several different types of computing environments. There is a large collaboration room consisting of conference tables with internet and electrical hook-ups for laptop use, a small fridge, sink and lounge area. The smaller room contains individual Windows workstations. Students have 24/7 secure access to the lab through their J-cards once validated. Additional facilities are available at the campus level, including general purpose computing labs, a digital media center, and wireless access to the Internet.</p><p>All CS students are eligible to receive accounts to access our undergraduate unix file server, as well as the Windows machines in the lab. In order to get access, you must submit an Account Request Form, available in the department main office, Croft 224. This generally takes a few days to process, then the computer staff will contact you to give you login and password information. You will need to bring your J-card to them in order to set-up access to the computer lab.</p><p>The unix server provides software that you will use in many courses, as well as email. The department maintains several mailing lists for sending notices to students. Make sure that the support staff and the DUS have the email address that you prefer to use on their lists. If you are not going to use your CS account for email, then you should set up an automatic forward to your email of choice. Please consult the computer support FAQ wiki on the department webpages to learn how to do common tasks. If you have questions or problems regarding the CS computing facilities at any point, please email &#8220;support@cs.jhu.edu&#8221; and be as specific as possible regarding the problem.</p></div></div></li><li class="accordion-group"><div class="accordion-heading"><h4 class="accordion-title"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1" href="#accordion-panel-7">Research and Honors</a></h4></div><div id="accordion-panel-7" class="accordion-body collapse out"><div class="accordion-inner"><p>In accordance with Hopkins&#8217; mission as a research university, undergraduate students in computer science are encouraged to gain some research experience. The primary mechanism for getting involved is to approach a faculty member whose area interests you and ask how you can participate. Generally the faculty member will expect you to have a course in their area in order to get a background for actual research projects. Several upper level courses have project components which often lead to further research. Also, some research groups may have opportunities to learn about their area while serving as a research lab administrator or webmaster.</p><p>In addition to the various independent undergraduate courses available in the department, there are several programs specifically designed to promote undergraduate research: the Pistritto Research Fellowship and the Senior Honors Thesis. Although both programs are usually pursued as individual efforts, they have supported group projects in the past.</p><p>The Pistritto Research Fellowship is an application based program which awards a stipend to a student annually for research in information visualization. A call for applications is sent via email each spring for the following academic year. The fellowship recipient may choose to pursue the research during the summer or during the regular school year, in conjunction with the sponsoring faculty member.</p><p>The Senior Honors Thesis program enables students with CS course GPAs of 3.5 or greater to pursue a full year (6 credits) of research with a faculty member. Interested students must submit a thesis proposal in spring of their junior year. If accepted, they will register for the courses 600.519 and 600.520 during senior year while doing the research. They are required to give a presentation on their work and submit a final thesis report at the end of the spring semester. With departmental faculty approval of the work, the student will then receive the distinction &#8220;Departmental Honors with Thesis&#8221; on his or her final transcript. Please visit the <a title="Senior Honors Thesis Program" href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/undergraduate-studies/student-resources/senior-honors-thesis-program/">Senior Thesis webpage</a> for more details.</p><p>Departmental Honors (without thesis) are awarded to students who graduate with a computer science course GPA of 3.5 or above.</p></div></div></li><li class="accordion-group"><div class="accordion-heading"><h4 class="accordion-title"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1" href="#accordion-panel-8">Internships and Careers</a></h4></div><div id="accordion-panel-8" class="accordion-body collapse out"><div class="accordion-inner"><p>Students are encouraged to pursue internships during winter and summer breaks. Generally these are done for money in the CS field. However, the unversity does have policies regarding receiving credit instead of pay for appropriately oriented work. The CS career coordinator is Dr. Peter Froehlich. He maintains and develops contacts with many companies, both local and national, to facilitate internship and job opportunities. Please check your CS email and keep your eyes out for flyers about company visits and information sessions within the department. You should also register with the campus Career Development Office in order to stay abreast of campus wide visits and job fairs. It is always the student&#8217;s responsibility to apply directly to a company for any internships or jobs which interest them. We do not have the authority to place students into any positions.</div></div></li><li class="accordion-group"><div class="accordion-heading"><h4 class="accordion-title"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1" href="#accordion-panel-9">Student Groups</a></h4></div><div id="accordion-panel-9" class="accordion-body collapse out"><div class="accordion-inner"><p>The CS department supports three student groups. First, we have a JHU Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). The ACM is an international professional organization of computer scientists. All students with an interest in computer science are encouraged to get involved in the ACM. The group has an office in Croft basement and runs weekly meetings on Thursday evenings during the school year. They also sponsor special events, which include pizza &amp; movie nights, as well as local and regional programming contests. Their website isÂ <a href="http://www.acm.jhu.edu/">www.acm.jhu.edu</a>.</p><p>We also have a JHU Chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE), which is the international computer science honor society. Students may apply for acceptance to UPE in their junior or senior years. Acceptance is based largely on academics (CS GPAs in particular), with some consideration for service as well. Members of our UPE chapter participate in various recruiting and other service projects in the department throughout the school year. Their website isÂ <a href="http://www.acm.jhu.edu/~upe">www.acm.jhu.edu/~upe</a>.</p><p>Women in the department will hopefully join WiCS, our women in CS group. Our main events are monthly dinner meetings with outside guest speakers. We also meet informally most weeks for &#8220;coding circles&#8221;. These are fun gatherings where we eat chocolate, talk about courses, help each other with homework (within the bounds of the ethics code of course), do our nails, talk about outside activities, careers, and whatever else might come up.</p></div></div></li><li class="accordion-group"><div class="accordion-heading"><h4 class="accordion-title"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1" href="#accordion-panel-10">Concurrent Program</a></h4></div><div id="accordion-panel-10" class="accordion-body collapse out"><div class="accordion-inner"><p>The concurrent program at Hopkins enables undergraduates to apply for and begin taking courses towards a Masters degree before completing their bachelor degrees. Most students apply for the program in their junior year, and will finish both degrees in five years total. It is not necessary for your undergraduate major and your masters degree to be in the exact same field. For example, many CS undergraduates do the concurrent program to get a Masters in Security Informatics. Mixing the degrees is also an alternative to doing a double major in closely related fields such as CS and computer engineering or math. As a concurrent student, you must satisfy all the requirements of your bachelors degree as well as all the requirements of the masters degree. Some departments may permit an overlap of at most two courses. All other courses, including undergraduate electives, must be separate and distinct for the two degrees. If you are interested in applying for the concurrent program, please see our Graduate Program Coordinator, Cathy Thorton, in Croft 224, or simply apply on-line through the <a title="Johns Hopkins Graduate Admissions" href="http://grad.jhu.edu" target="_blank">university&#8217;s graduate admissions website</a>.</p></div></div></li><li class="accordion-group"><div class="accordion-heading"><h4 class="accordion-title"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1" href="#accordion-panel-11">Major Degree Requirements</a></h4></div><div id="accordion-panel-11" class="accordion-body collapse out"><div class="accordion-inner"><p>This section provides the nitty-gritty details and clarifications of the requirements for the BS and BA major programs. It is organized according to requirement category, and within each provides specifics for each program.<br /> &nbsp;</p><h4>Computer Science Courses</h4><p>Required courses:</p><ul><li>600.104 Computer Ethics (BS only)</li><li>600.107 Intro Programming in JAVA or AP equivalent</li><li>600.120 Intermediate Programming</li><li>600.226 Data Structures</li><li>600.233 Computer System Fundamentals (formerly 600.333)</li><li>600.271 Automata and Computation Theory</li><li>600.363/463 Algorithms (added Fall 2011)</li></ul><p>The total number of CS credits must be at least 42 for the BS and 33 for the BA (formerly 30, changed in 2013), including the required courses and upper level courses (&gt;=300). BA students must have at least 15 upper level credits; BS students must have at least 16 upper level credits. Furthermore, BS students must have at least one upper level course in each classification area of Analysis, Applications and Systems. (An exhaustive list of the area classifications for each of our courses may be found on the departmentâ€™s Web site.) BS students must also take at least one of the following courses which contain oral communication components: 600.255, 600.321/421, 600.355, 600.392, 600.446, 600.493, 600.520. This course may overlap other course requirements, for example to count as oral and applications.</p><p>These additional rules regarding the CS course requirements apply to students in both programs:</p><ul><li>At most 3 credits of short courses (1 credit each) can be counted toward this requirement.</li><li>No courses with grades below C- or with S/U grades can be used to fulfill this requirement, unless they are not offered for a grade.</li><li>With the adviser&#8217;s explicit permission regarding course selections, up to 6 (BS) or 3 (BA) of the required CS credits may be taken in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering or the Information Security Institute.</li><li>The limits on total independent credits (including 600.491-492) are 6 for the BS and 3 for the BA. However, students doing the Senior Honors Thesis (600.519-520) may use an additional three credits of independent work toward their CS requirements.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Math Courses</h4><p>CS majors must take the following courses:</p><ul><li>110.108 Calculus I or AP equivalent</li><li>110.109 Calculus II or AP equivalent</li><li>550.171 Discrete Mathematics</li></ul><p>The total math credits must be at least 22 for the BS and 18 for the BA. All courses in this category must be from one of the two math departments on campus: Mathematics or Applied Math and Statistics. (&#8216;Q&#8217; designated courses in other departments can not be counted here.) For the BS all the remaining courses must be 200-level or above. For the BA at least one must be 200-level or above. Lastly, the BS math courses must include coverage of both probability and statistics. For BS students, AP Statistics credit covers the need for statistics (not probability) but may not be counted towards the math credit requirements. Some highly recommended math electives are Probability &amp; Statistics, Calculus III, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Science Courses</h4><p>The required number of basic science credits is 16 for the BS and 12 for the BA. At least two semesters of physics or two semesters of chemistry, with the associated laboratories, must be included. (The BA permits one of each.) AP credit is an acceptable substitute for these courses and labs. The remaining courses must be chosen in accordance with the list posted on the department&#8217;s Web site, which includes most courses from the five basic science departments: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Biophysics, Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences. It also includes &#8216;N&#8217; designated engineering courses, and some &#8216;N&#8217; designated courses from Neuroscience &amp; Cognitive Science, but not all. It does not include &#8216;N&#8217; courses in other KSAS departments. At most 2 credits of intersession (S/U) &#8216;N&#8217; courses may be applied towards this requirement. If it&#8217;s not obvious whether a particular course will count towards this requirement, ask your advisor or Joanne.</p><h4>Liberal Arts</h4><p>The liberal arts requirements can be divided into three groups: H/S courses, foreign languages, and writing courses.</p><ul><li>Six courses, each at least 3 credits, in the humanities and social sciences must be taken. These courses must have either an &#8216;H&#8217; or &#8216;S&#8217; area designator on them, but can be from any department. For the BA degree, at least two of these courses must be at the 300-level or above. Furthermore, a subset of the courses selected to satisfy this requirement should demonstrate coherence within an area.</li><li>BA students are required to take at least 6 credits of foreign language in addition to the six H/S required courses. BS students are not required to take a foreign language, but they may count foreign language courses towards broadening electives (see below), or towards the H/S requirement above, even if they don&#8217;t carry an &#8216;H&#8217; or &#8216;S&#8217; designator. However, they must still have at least six (&gt;=3)-credit courses to fulfill the H/S requirement.</li><li>The university requires writing (&#8216;W&#8217;) designated courses, each at least 3 credits, for all degree programs. BS students must take at least 2 of these courses, and BA students must take at least 4. The courses used to satisfy this requirement may overlap with other categories, such as H/S credits or electives. Students must receive at least a C- grade or better in these writing courses. At least one of the following options should be chosen:<ul><li>060.113 Expository Writing</li><li>220.105/106 Intro to Fiction and Poetry Writing</li><li>661.110 Professional Communication</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Electives and Total Credits</h4><p>The total number of credits required for the BS degree is 126, and 120 for the BA. The requirements above add up to 98 credits for the BS and 84 credits for the BA, leaving room for electives. BS students must take at least 12 elective credits in the humanities, social science, arts, business, science, engineering or other disciplines that serve to broaden the student&#8217;s background. These 12 broadening credits are in addition to the H/S requirements above, and may be anything other than CS, ECE or math courses. Except for electives, courses should not be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. Freshmen majors are expected to take 600.105 M&amp;Ms as one of their elective credits. By university policy, no more than 18 D or D+ credits can be counted toward the total credit requirements for a degree.</p><p>A sample schedule may be found online for theÂ <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/current-undergraduate/BSsample.pdf">BS</a>Â degree.</p></div></div></li><li class="accordion-group"><div class="accordion-heading"><h4 class="accordion-title"><a class="accordion-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#accordion1" href="#accordion-panel-12">Tracks</a></h4></div><div id="accordion-panel-12" class="accordion-body collapse out"><div class="accordion-inner"><p>The faculty have developed several tracks within the major in order to help students plan a course of study focusing on a particular area. Many of these highlight the particular strengths of our faculty and research here at Hopkins. It is important to emphasize that majors are not required to choose a track, they are simply options for customizing your studies. Below you will find detailed descriptions for five tracks:Â <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/current-undergraduate/advisemain.html#nlp">Natural Language Processing</a>,Â <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/current-undergraduate/advisemain.html#se">Software Engineering</a>,Â <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/current-undergraduate/advisemain.html#is">Information Security</a>,Â <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/current-undergraduate/advisemain.html#games">Video Game Design</a>, andÂ <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/current-undergraduate/advisemain.html#">Robotics</a>. Others are likely to be added in the future.</p><h4 id="nlp">Natural Language Processing</h4><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence. Its goal is to build programs that can analyze, understand, produce, and transform text in natural human languages such as English, Chinese, or Malayalam. Natural languages are fascinatingly complex symbolic systems. Unlike programming languages, they were not designed to be easy for computers to understand. Yet humans cope with them effortlessly.</p><p>Major questions in NLP include: How should we formally represent the structure and meaning of words, sentences, or documents? What algorithms can efficiently find the most likely meaning for a given sentence &#8212; or the best sentence to express a given meaning? What exactly do these algorithms need to know about English, Chinese, Malayalam, or the topics that the sentences discuss? Must we write down that knowledge ourselves, or can our computers automatically learn languages from available data? Finally, what practically useful applications can we devise?</p><p>NLP skills are in demand for applications that encounter large quantities of text or speech. Examples include search engines, recommendation systems, digital libraries, word processors, email interfaces, cell phone and PDA services, market research, automated customer service, medical records entry and analysis, national security applications, education software, information access and communication by the disabled, language services like translation and transcription, and all manner of data mining efforts that try to determine what a community knows or thinks. NLP skills are also very relevant to computational biology, computational finance, music processing, speech processing, data mining, machine learning, linguistics, cognitive science, and other areas of artificial intelligence.</p><p>A 4-year program of study should include coursework from the three major technical areas needed for NLP. Linguistics studies the formal properties of natural language; statistics is used to learn from data what the best output might be; and computational algorithms are used to search efficiently for the best output or the best statistical model in an enormous space of possibilities.</p><p>Courses marked below with an asterisk should almost always be included. F/S indicate which courses have historically been offered in fall/spring.</p><p><em>Core courses.</em>Â Students concentrating in NLP should take at least two of the following courses, in any order:</p><pre>   (F) 600.465 Natural Language Processing *
   (S) 600.466 Information Retrieval and Web Agents
   (S) 600.666 Information Extraction from Speech and Text</pre><p>They will want to take 600.465 as soon as feasible (after completing 600.226 Data Structures).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Algorithms.</em>Â NLP concentrators will also want to study methods that are useful for artificial intelligence more generally. They should take at least two of the following courses, in any order:</p><pre>   (S) 600.335/435 Artificial Intelligence
   (S) 600.325/425 Declarative Methods
   (F,S) 600.363/463 Introduction to Algorithms</pre><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Linguistics.</em>Â All NLP concentrators should take at least one of the following 300-level linguistics courses, typically including syntax. Note that all 050.xxx courses count as &#8220;broadening electives&#8221; for the CS major.</p><pre>   (F) 050.320/620 Syntax I *
   (F) 050.317/617 Semantics I
   (S) 050.325/625 Phonology I</pre><p>All of these courses expect some prior exposure to linguistics, typically via 050.102, 050.240, or 600.465.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Students who choose the track early can obtain useful background in linguistics, psycholinguistics and formal language theory starting in the freshman or sophomore year. The following courses have no prerequisites:</p><pre>   (S) 600.271 Automata and Computation Theory * (required for CS degree)
   (S) 050.102 Language and Mind
   (S) 050.240 The World of Language</pre><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Statistics.</em>Â Modern NLP relies heavily on statistical methods to make sense of ambiguous language and to learn from data. While all CS majors are required to take some probability and statistics, concentrators in NLP should obtain a firm grounding in machine learning and its mathematical underpinnings. They should take</p><pre>   (S) 600.475 Machine Learning *
   (F) 550.420 Introduction to Probability
   (S) 550.430 Introduction to Statistics</pre><p>although if absolutely necessary, this may be condensed to</p><pre>   (S) 600.475 Machine Learning *
   (F,S) 550.310 Probability and Statistics</pre><p>Students are also encouraged to consider</p><pre>   (F) 520.447 Introduction to Information Theory and Coding
   (F) 550.361 Introduction to Optimization</pre><p>Most of these courses can be applied toward the mathematics requirements of the CS degree.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>5-year program.</em>Â Students in the concurrent BS/MS program will typically take a larger selection of the above courses, and take more of them at the 400 or 600 level. In the fourth or fifth year (after taking 600.465 or 600.666), they will want to participate in research activities or special-topics courses related to NLP.

Make sure you take as many courses as you can that involve team project work, as well as participating in extracurricular activities that are teamwork activities.</p><h4 id="is">Information Security</h4><p>Information Security is a broad topic description. It typically spans every aspect of a system, including authentication, authorization, access control, resistance to penetration, and privacy. Security must be designed into a system from the beginning. It cannot be retrofitted. Security analysis and design begins with a threat model. Who are the adversaries? What are the goals of the adversary? What are his/her capabilities? How resourceful and wealthy is the adversary? Once the threat model is identified, the proper level of security can be applied.</p><p>Sub areas in security include software security, network security, system security, security in applications, and cryptography. Each of these sub areas can be further broken down. Some concepts span multiple sub areas. For example, security protocols such as SSL and SSH have strong system components and also rely on cryptographic protocols and algorithms. Application areas include everything from security in electronic voting, to protecting medical records, and just about any application that talks to a network or takes user input.</p><p>The Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute (JHUISI) makes available a Master of Science in Security Informatics (MSSI) degree to students interested in information security that can be included in a concurrent BS/MSSI program that addresses not only technical issues but also relevant aspects of policy, privacy, management, including healthcare applications. Please see the JHUISI web site for information on the MSSI requirements.</p><p>A 4-year program of study should include coursework from the major technical sub areas needed for Security that are listed above.</p><p>Courses marked below with an asterisk should almost always be included. F/S indicate which courses have historically been offered in fall/spring. Not every course is offered every year.</p><p><em>Core courses.</em>Â Students concentrating in Security are required to take one of the following cryptography courses:</p><pre>   (F) 600.442 Modern Cryptography*

Much like motion pictures in the early part of the 20th century, video games have now become a major player in the entertainment industry and are prevalent enough to warrant academic attention from a wide variety of disciplines. An increasing number of highly ranked universities across the country are now offering programs that focus on video games (CMU, Rensselaer, USC, UCSC, UCI, Cornell, etc).</p><p>Aside from being immensely relevant, courses in video game design are by necessity also highly interdisciplinary. Students surveyed after our first pilot course in Spring 2008 were almost unanimous about their positive experience in working with people from a wide variety of backgrounds. The track reflects this by suggesting a large number of courses that would not necessarily seem particularly &#8220;appropriate&#8221; for a CS major if we were not talking about gaming.</p><p><em>Courses.</em>Â A four-year program of study should include coursework from both technical and artistic areas. The technical area focuses on computer science, math, and physics; the artistic area focuses on graphic design, modeling, and sound design. Courses marked below with an asterisk should almost always be included.</p><p><em>Writing Requirement.</em>Â Students in the Video Game Design track must take these courses, which also fulfill their writing requirement for the BS and can be used towards the BA writing requirement as well.</p><pre>   JHU 220.105 Introduction to Fiction and Poetry Writing

Also, we need to double-check with MICA faculty about their courses. MICA recently started their own gaming program and no doubt some courses have changed.]</p><h4 id="rob">Robotics</h4><p>The field of Robotics integrates sensing, information processing, and movement to accomplish specific tasks in the physical world. As such, the study of robotics can encompass several topics, including mechanics and dynamics, kinematics, sensing, signal processing, control systems, planning, and artificial intelligence. Applications of these concepts appear in many areas including medicine, manufacturing, space exploration, disaster recovery, ordinance disposal, deep-sea navigation, home care, and home automation. There are variety of sub-specializations of robotics that are more algorithmic or systems-oriented in nature. Examples include robot motion planning, robot task planning, sensor-based mapping, computer vision, and human-machine systems. The robotics track is designed to emphasize these areas of work.</p><p>For students interested in a broader exposure to robotics, the faculty of the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR), in collaboration with the academic departments and centers of the Whiting School of Engineering, offers a Robotics Minor in order to provide a structure in which undergraduate students at Johns Hopkins. The minor is not &#8220;owned&#8221; by any one department, but rather it is managed by the LCSR itself. Any student from any department within the university can work toward the minor.</p><p>A 4-year program of study should include coursework from the major technical sub areas needed for Robotics that are listed above.</p><p>Courses marked below with an asterisk should almost always be included.
