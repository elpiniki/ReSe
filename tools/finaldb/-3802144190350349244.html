		<h3>Nuclear Non-Proliferation Challenges in the 21st Century</h3>

		<p class="course_meta"><strong>Program Type:</strong> Graduate &nbsp; <strong>Course Number:</strong> SA.680.786 (01) &nbsp; <strong>Credits:</strong> 4 &nbsp; <strong>Semester:</strong> Spring</p>

		<p><strong>Location:</strong> Washington D.C. center &nbsp; <strong>Date and Time:</strong> Th 6:00 - 8:00 PM<br /><strong>Instructor(s):</strong> R. Alavrez, B. MacDonald &nbsp; </p>

		Nuclear energy can be used for peaceful purposes or for nuclear weapons. An international non-proliferation regime was established based on the 1968 Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The Treaty assigned responsibility International Atomic Energy Agency of the United Nations for applying safeguards to nuclear and related materials, nuclear equipment and facilities to ensure that they remain in peaceful use. New challenges arise from resurgent interest by some nations in acquiring nuclear weapons to meet their perceived security needs, and the recent revival of interest in nuclear power as a carbon-free energy source, including from developing countries that have no experience in nuclear technology. In addition, with the end of the Cold War there is a new threat of nuclear terrorism from acts of malice, diversion, sale, and theft of nuclear material and technologies. This course will explore how nuclear weapons work, why some countries are tempted to seek them, and the implications of nuclear weapons for civilian nuclear power and geopolitical stability. Students will gain an understanding of the political and military dynamics of nuclear weapons, ways to slow or halt the spread of such weapons and how to reduce the dangers of nuclear terrorism. Group discussions, simulated exercises, and guest lecturers will introduce additional real-world dimensions into the classroom

		<h3>International Wildlife Conservation</h3>

		<p class="course_meta"><strong>Program Type:</strong> Graduate &nbsp; <strong>Course Number:</strong> SA.680.881(01) &nbsp; <strong>Credits:</strong> 4 &nbsp; <strong>Semester:</strong> Fall</p>

		<p><strong>Location:</strong> Washington D.C. Center &nbsp; <strong>Date and Time:</strong> Th 2:15 - 4:15PM<br /><strong>Instructor(s):</strong> H. Eves &nbsp; </p>

		Wildlife populations around the globe are under serious threat, impacted by human activity, development, and encroaching industry, much of which is prompted by decisions made by governments and other institutions. Local-level land-use, local, national and international policies, and human trade and development activities heavily influence wildlife populations and the potential for their protection and management. This course provides an overview of the theory and practice of wildlife conservation internationally, with a focus on African wildlife. The objectives of the course are to provide knowledge on policies and practices used to protect and manage wildlife populations, especially as they compete with other development goals. The course will examine: the major issues of concern in global wildlife conservation; the US-based and international agencies working toward wildlife conservation objectives and the way they interact with other "development" groups implementing projects in conservation areas; the impact of major international treaties; and, conservation practices across key regions of the globe.

		<h3>International Water: Issues and Policies</h3>

		<p class="course_meta"><strong>Program Type:</strong> Graduate &nbsp; <strong>Course Number:</strong> SA.680.738 (01) &nbsp; <strong>Credits:</strong> 4 &nbsp; <strong>Semester:</strong> Spring</p>

		<p><strong>Location:</strong> Washington DC Center &nbsp; <strong>Date and Time:</strong> M 6:00 - 8:00PM<br /><strong>Instructor(s):</strong> W. Yu &nbsp; </p>

		Is it true as recent headlines suggest that our fragile planet is on the loom of a grave water crisis, that our rivers are running dry and groundwater aquifers increasingly over-tapped and over-exploited, that wars will be fought between nations over this precious resource (more valuable than oil), and that this is likely to affect the development opportunities for a large share of the world population? Or is this looming crisis over-hyped, a matter of political will and proper pricing, and within the capacity of society to manage? Water is a classic renewable resource, essential to life on this planet. Water sustains the livelihoods of society and makes productive economic activity possible. For such an important resource, it is no wonder that issues surrounding its use (and abuse) can generate cause for so much passionate controversy and concern. This course is a broad survey of the international water issues facing the 21st century. Topics to be covered include, privatization of water service delivery, conflict and cooperation on trans-boundary rivers, the role of large multi-purpose reservoirs (for hydropower, water supply, irrigation), water as a human right, achieving the Millennium Development Goals on water supply and sanitation, the role of water in food security, and climate change. Any discourse today on sustainable development is not complete without a discussion of the important role of water to society.

		<p><strong>Location:</strong> Washington D.C. Center &nbsp; <strong>Date and Time:</strong> Th 7:00 - 9:00PM<br /><strong>Instructor(s):</strong> A. Stolle &nbsp; </p>

		The main focus of this course is to deal with forest issues in an international setting, looking into current state and threats, forest management for wood products, trade, and the important role of forests in the climate debate. However, this course will also look into some of the socio-economic functions of forests in developing tropical countries as well as the regulatory and policy context in which those countries manage their forests and their relations with forest dependent peoples and communities. This will include issues such as land rights, logging titles, forest concessions systems, forest revenue systems benefit sharing mechanisms, and the role of climate change. Each of the session will discuss separate but inter-meshed issues, through review and analysis of concepts, policies etc., as well as illustrative practical examples in a tropical country (mainly Congo Basin countries and Indonesia).

		<p><strong>Location:</strong> Online &nbsp; <strong>Date and Time:</strong> N/A<br /><strong>Instructor(s):</strong> S. Putnam  &nbsp; </p>

		This course examines the greening of industry trend, its causes, and its implications for public policy. The course first examines environmental behavior from the strategic perspective of firms and industry associations. From the old emphasis on legal compliance, leading firms now have turned to a much more strategic view, and many have adopted an explicit goal of promoting sustainability. We consider the causes of this behavior among leading firms and the many forms that it has taken, as well as the meanings of sustainability within the industrial sector. The course then turns to a consideration of how public policy has influenced this trend and to government's response to these changes within industry. The course concludes with an evaluation of these policy responses and likely trends in industry and government.

		The purpose of this class is to understand the landscape-scale controls on the fluxes of water and waterborne materials through watersheds. This class differs from the Hydrology and Hydrologic Modeling classes in its focus on data analysis, and its embrace of the complexity of real landscapes. There will be significant quantitative components to the material taught, but emphasis will be on developing a greater sense of the way that landscapes "function", and how this function is related to real-world issues of water resources and pollution. Students will gain an understanding of how climate, geologic and ecologic setting, and human impacts control the partitioning of water between different fates, the flowpaths through the landscape and the storage and residence time of water. They will also learn conceptual and practical tools for analyzing hydrologic and other landscape data, and integrating this data in a holistic approach to watershed analysis. The class will be of interest for students intending to go into watershed or landscape management, and anyone wishing to pursue research in hydrology, geomorphology or ecology at landscape and watershed scales. The class will include at least one field trip to an instrumented watershed. GIS skills will be an advantage but are not required.
