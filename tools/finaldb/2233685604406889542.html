<p><b>Boston University Operating Systems and Services</b></p>
<h1> Overview</h1>
<p>The BOSS group focuses on research topics that involve mechanisms,
policies and implementations of next-generation operating systems and
services.
Of particular interest are topics addressing the design of distributed
real-time and adaptive systems, scheduling policies, service
abstractions, system extensibility, safety and control theoretic
issues.</p>
<p>We may, on occasion, discuss kernel internals and
architecture-specific issues relating to the design of novel system
abstractions.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you are not a member of the BOSS group and would like to
join, please send email to
