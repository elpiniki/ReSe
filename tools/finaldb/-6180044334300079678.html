<div>
	Focus: Improving waste disposal practices in Baltimore neighborhoods (in collaboration with Aravind Menon)</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Major cities around the world continually struggle with the issue of waste disposal and litter. While studies have examined been conducted regarding littering practices in the United States, most have been conducted in non-urban settings, leaving a gap in research for an area that would benefit most from improvement strategies. High rates of litter and poor waste management practices are associated with low socioeconomic status, poor health and higher crime rates. Poor waste management can also increase flooding and contamination when storm drains are clogged during inclement weather.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Rachel Goodermote is working with a research team to better understand waste disposal practices in low-income neighborhoods by conducting surveys and interviews to better identify barriers and opportunities that exist to improve waste disposal behavior in Baltimore. Through this project, they hope to create a toolkit of investigative methods from varying disciplines including psychology, applied anthropology, economics and geography to improve waste behavior in Baltimore and cities worldwide in the future.&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ragooder@jhsph.edu">Contact Rachel to learn more about the research</a></div>

	Focus: The coal industry&#39;s occupational safety in Northeast, PA</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Coal is projected to be the largest source of America&rsquo;s energy as far as in 2035, and it is likely that the number of employees in this industry will continue to grow. Given the dangerous nature of coal mining, data is regularly gathered on visible and reported injuries and fatalities. However, the near injury misses and unreported injuries are gone unnoticed. Such a gap may have implications for the coal industry&rsquo;s occupational safety. So far, there have been mixed results in reducing injuries and fatalities from the training that coal miners receive.</div>
<div>
	<br />
	Mohd. Nasir Mohd. Ismail&rsquo;s research includes observing the coal miners in their work environment and examining the risks that the workers face, with the goal of improving occupational safety in the coal industry. In particular, he aims to include the invisible data - the coal miners&rsquo; perceived injury, environmental, and health risks. Ismail&rsquo;s data and observations can help create a new understanding of why injuries and fatalities occur in the coal industry by taking into account the miners&rsquo; perceptions of risks they face, as well as the environment and culture they work and live in. By including such invisible data, Ismail&rsquo;s research can contribute to policies that effectively help keep workers in this industry safe. <a href="mailto:e2shi@jhu.edu">Contact E&sup2;SHI to learn more about the research</a></div>

<div>
	Focus: Decision-making during environmental disasters</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Recently, there has been a growing recognition that climate change is occurring and that natural disasters will continue to increase as a consequence. Public health leaders and other officials are faced with complex decisions how to protect the public&rsquo;s health and safety in light of increasing numbers and severity of natural disasters.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Meghan McGinty will explore how public officials and hospital administrators make choices during environmental emergencies by analyzing decisions made during Hurricane Sandy. Ultimately, she aims to communicate the results with public health leaders to enable them to make effective, sustainable decisions while addressing the threats posed by global climate change and environmental disasters. <a href="mailto:mmcginty@jhsph.edu">Contact Meghan for more information</a></div>

		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		Aravind Menon is currently working with a research team on a qualitative research project to understand how waste is created and disposed in the city of Baltimore. Through field observations, interviews and group discussions, they intend to understand the determinants of littering and household waste disposal behaviors in Baltimore, and to gain insight into the trash collection services provided by the city. Ultimately, this project hopes to inform a larger study that looks at waste management issues at a personal, household and societal level in Baltimore, and its impact on critical ecosystems in the Baltimore watershed area.</div>

<div>
	Focus: Sustainable renewable energy technology through the conversion of carbon dioxide emissions into productive energy</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<div>
		Fossil fuels account for the majority of the world&rsquo;s energy consumption. While energy demand continues to rise, such fossil fuels are finite and bear environmental ramifications. In particular, the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide emitted as a result from burning fossil fuels has been linked to contributing to climate change.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		David Raciti will explore a renewable and carbon dioxide-neutral energy alternative by developing a chemical reaction (catalyst) to convert carbon dioxide into fuel. He will specifically examine the role of noble metal-semiconductor heterodimer nanoparticles in converting carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon fuels (energy). Raciti&rsquo;s research can ultimately help develop more efficient and sustainable renewable energy technologies while finding solutions for using excess carbon dioxide emissions into productive energy. <a href="mailto:draciti1@jhu.edu">Contact David Raciti for more information</a></div>

<div>
	Focus: Making microalgal biofuel production more cost-effective and sustainable</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Many forms of food and biofuel crop production can have harmful environmental consequences, such as eroding soil and depleting water. Fertilizer running off the land into waterways from agriculture can lead to algae overgrowth that chokes the life out of aquatic regions. At the same time, algae can also restore poor quality water and produce alternative energy as a biomass feedstock for third-generation biofuels, or biofuels that are not crop-based or terrestrial-based.</div>
<div>
	<br />
	In his research, Julian Rosenberg aims to improve microalgal biofuel production by reducing nutrient, energy, and water inputs and improving cultivation efficiency from single celled algae, while making the process more cost-effective and sustainable. His current project focuses on implementing engineered biofilms &ndash; or assemblies of microorganisms on a surface &ndash; in concert with sequential growth conditions utilizing organic wastes to create less resource intensive algae production systems. In the end, Rosenberg&rsquo;s research can help address resource challenges that the world faces today, including water, waste, food, and fuel. <a href="mailto:jrosenberg@jhu.edu">Contact Julian for more information</a></div>

	Focus:&nbsp;Irrigation and hydropower strategies in Sudan and climate change&#39;s challenges</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<div>
		Developing countries are increasingly faced with balancing natural resources with population growth, economic development, energy consumption, and food security. The Nile River basin is comprised of eleven different countries in Africa, with Sudan at the center of the basin that affects hydropower and irrigation strategies for energy and water resources needed in the country.</div>
	<div>
		&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		Saleh Satti will focus on the optimal hydropower and irrigation strategies for the Sudan under evolving climate conditions and development within Sudan and upstream in the Nile River basin. Satti&rsquo;s research aims to help improve the understanding of climate change&rsquo;s challenges and implications for the Sudanese Nile, and in turn, the potential effects of Sudan&rsquo;s irrigation and hydropower projects on the energy and food security of the region. <a href="mailto:ssatti1@jhu.edu">Contact Saleh for more information</a></div>

<div>
	Focus: Sustainable and cost-effective drinking water treatment technology&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Low Pressure Membrane (LPM) filtration is a popular water treatment strategy because it requires little energy and has demonstrated ability to improve the safety of drinking water for municipal, community and household applications. Commercially available LPMs often include either polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or polyethersulfone (PES), which are membranes that filter out harmful contaminants from water. The membranes contain pores ranging from 0.01 micrometer (&micro;m) to 0.1 &micro;m in size, which affect how much contaminants can be removed.</div>
<div>
	<br />
	However, LPM requires technology that is currently not very efficient. Biofouling &ndash; or the process of particles depositing onto the membrane surface or pores &ndash; can occur and degrades the membrane&rsquo;s performance, which can pose a threat to public health. To reduce this harm, Li Tang will focus on increasing the membrane&rsquo;s resistance to biofouling by exploring polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) &ndash; a thin film with a layered structure &ndash; as a possible solution. In doing so, her research can lead to a sustainable and cost-effective design and operation that may potentially improve water filtration. <a href="mailto:Li_tang@jhu.edu">Contact Li for more information</a></div>
